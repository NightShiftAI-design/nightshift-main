          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How fast can we get NightShift installed?</h3>
            <p>
              Most properties go live quickly. We collect your property details (rates, policies, escalation contacts),
              configure your script, and test the call flow before you forward your line.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Does NightShift follow ADA rules for service animals?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes — NightShift is configured to follow ADA-aligned handling and avoids asking for documentation or proof.
              Your pet fees and service animal rules are applied exactly as you specify.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can NightShift book rooms?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. It can collect dates, nights, guest count, and room type, then follow your booking workflow.
              If you want bookings to route to staff for confirmation, we can do that too.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Is this PCI compliant?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift can be configured to avoid collecting card numbers and instead route payments through your existing
              secure process (front desk, payment link, or your preferred method).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>What if a caller has an emergency?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift uses safe emergency handling language and can route urgent calls based on your rules.
              It does not provide medical or legal advice.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can NightShift match or view online rates?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift doesn’t browse OTAs. If a guest mentions a rate, we can follow your policy
              (match, explain, or escalate to the front desk/manager).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Which hotel brands can use NightShift?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift supports independent properties and can be tailored for franchise environments with
              brand-safe scripting, terminology, and structured call flows.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can we customize the script?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Your script can include address, amenities, fees, rates, smoking policy, pet rules,
              late check-in procedures, and staff contact rules — all tailored to your property.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Does NightShift speak other languages?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes — multi-language support can be enabled based on your setup (e.g., Spanish, Hindi, Gujarati, and more),
              with a professional tone in each language.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>What happens if NightShift can’t answer a question?</h3>
            <p>
              It escalates cleanly to your staff (front desk/GM) based on your routing rules — no loops,
              no dead ends, and no confusing handoffs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How does NightShift handle weekly rates?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift can present nightly vs weekly pricing and follow your exact quoting logic,
              including deposits, taxes/fees, and your policy language.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Is this replacing staff?</h3>
            <p>
              No — it supports your team by handling repetitive calls, reducing missed bookings,
              and improving response time after hours so staff can focus on guests in person.
            </p>
