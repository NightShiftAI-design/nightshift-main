          NightShift AI is a virtual front desk trained on your property — not a reservation call center.
          It’s designed to answer calls professionally after-hours, follow your policies, and escalate correctly.

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How fast can we get NightShift installed?</h3>
            <p>
              Many properties can go live quickly. We collect your property details (rates, policies, escalation contacts),
              configure the workflows, and test call handling before you forward your after-hours line.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Is NightShift a call center?</h3>
            <p>
              No. NightShift is a virtual front desk trained on your hotel’s policies and procedures.
              It’s built for guest operations (questions, issues, late arrivals, escalation) — not just reservations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can NightShift take reservations?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. It can capture dates, nights, guest count, and room type, then follow your booking workflow.
              If you prefer, reservation attempts can be routed to staff for confirmation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Do you collect credit card numbers?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift can be configured to avoid collecting card numbers and instead route payments through your existing secure process
              (front desk workflow, payment link, or your preferred method).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How does NightShift handle service animals and ADA-sensitive situations?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift can be configured with ADA-aware workflows and consistent handling.
              For sensitive scenarios, you can require escalation to staff so a human makes the final decision.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>What if a caller has an emergency?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift is designed to recognize urgent situations and escalate immediately to your designated contacts.
              It can also instruct callers to contact emergency services when appropriate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>What if NightShift can’t answer a question?</h3>
            <p>
              It escalates cleanly to your staff based on routing rules you control — with context, not confusion.
              No loops, no dead ends, and no “try calling back later.”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can we customize the scripts and policies?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. We configure your property info and policies: fees, deposits, smoking rules, pets, late check-in procedures,
              quiet hours, and escalation rules — tailored to your operation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Does NightShift support multiple languages?</h3>
            <p>
              Multi-language support can be enabled based on your setup (for example: Spanish, Hindi, Gujarati and more).
              The caller experience stays professional and hospitality-focused.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Can NightShift match online rates or check OTAs?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift doesn’t browse OTAs. If a guest mentions a rate, NightShift can follow your policy
              (explain, offer your approved rate, or escalate to staff).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>How does NightShift handle weekly rates and extended stays?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift can present nightly vs weekly pricing and follow your quoting logic,
              including deposits and policy language you specify.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>Is this replacing staff?</h3>
            <p>
              NightShift replaces overnight call handling — not your entire front desk.
              Routine calls get resolved automatically, and sensitive situations get escalated to a human based on your rules.
              The goal is fewer overnight staffing hours and fewer missed calls.
            </p>
