        <h1 class="section-title">Built by someone who actually runs hotels.</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          NightShift wasn’t born in a software incubator. It came from years of watching family members
          answer calls at 1–3 AM, juggle walk-ins, and still try to act friendly to every guest.
        </p>

          <h3>Why NightShift exists</h3>
          <p style="font-size:13px;color:#cbd5f5;">
            I grew up in and around hospitality. Every family gathering included at least one phone call from a guest,
            a vendor, or someone asking if they could check in “just a little bit early”.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:13px;color:#cbd5f5;">
            Over the years I watched owners and managers lose sleep, miss dinners, and burn out trying to cover phones
            at all hours. Hiring a full night staff is expensive. Outsourcing to massive call centers often feels impersonal
            and disconnected from how independents actually run.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:13px;color:#cbd5f5;">
            NightShift was built to solve that very specific pain: giving independent owners their nights back,
            without sacrificing bookings or guest experience.
          </p>

          <h3>How we work with you</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>We start small – usually one property and limited hours – so you can hear NightShift in action.</li>
            <li>We configure policies and edge cases based on your real-world experience, not generic documentation.</li>
            <li>We review early call summaries together and fine-tune tone, routing, and rules.</li>
            <li>We grow coverage only when it feels like a net positive for you and your team.</li>
          </ul>

          If you’re running a property yourself today, you don’t need another long sales deck.
          You need to know whether NightShift actually works for hotels like yours.
